Description: BBS client written in Qt
 FQTerm is one of the most widely used BBS client in China, it
 supports Telnet/SSH1/SSH2 protocols and can process ANSI control
 sequences. It can be used to login BBS sites or *NIX hosts.
 .
 Almost all the BBSes in Greater China Region are in BIG5 or GBK
 encoding. So FQTerm only support these two encodings and ASCII.
