<H1>SYNOPSIS</H1>
This is a program to test the compatibility (or to demonstrate the
non-compatibility) of so-called "VT100-compatible" terminals. In
conformance of the good old hacker traditions, the only documentation
of this program is the source code itself. To understand it, you also
need a copy of the original VT100 manual from DEC.<P>

Additional tests (past version 1.7) are provided for analysis of
vt220, vt420 terminals, as well as variants of xterm.

<H1>HISTORY</H1>
<STRONG>Vttest 1.7</STRONG> was written in 1986 by
Per Lindberg at the Stockholm University Computing Center.
I began this version in mid-1996 to support changes that I am making to
<A HREF="../xterm/xterm.html">xterm</A>.
See the <a href="CHANGES">changelog</a> for details.
